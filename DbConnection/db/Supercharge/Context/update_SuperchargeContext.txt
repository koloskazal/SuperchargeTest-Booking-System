This project contains the database connection, the models and the repositories. It can
contain db services as well, but only if they are not business logic related such as logging.
Don't modify the scaffolded files, because they will be overwritten when you scaffold again.
In case you have to modify the scaffolded model files, use inheritance or partial classes.
In case it can't be done, make a note about the necessary changes in the 'Todos after the scaffolding' section.
Scaffolding always has to be full, don't limit it to specific tables. 

Todos after the scaffolding:
- Change the inheritance of the context from DbContext to DbContectExtended

Kolos-local:
Scaffold-DbContext "Server=.\MSSQLSERVER01;Database=Supercharge;Trusted_Connection=True;TrustServerCertificate=True;" -Project DbConnection Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer -f -NoOnConfiguring -OutputDir db/Supercharge/Model -ContextDir db/Supercharge/Context -Context SuperchargeContext
